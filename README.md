# AR BasketBall

A simple basketball game with augmented reality :basketball:

**How does it work?**

This app will display a basket & a ball over the correct graphic. Once the models are visible on screen, you will be able to throw the ball: just touch the ball and drag your finger to the desired direction :iphone::arrow_left::point_up_2:

**Requirements** :tools:

- An Android device with accelerometer, camera & android 5.1 or above :calling:
- This [this image](http://imgur.com/DSS70jM) printed! It doesn't matter if color or grayscale :cat:
- The app installed, you can download it from [this url](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.InformalPenguins.ARBasketBall) :link:

**Note**
- Currently not working on iOS or OSX environments :(
- If you want to modify the source, you need Unity 5.4 working on Windows OS
